An integer of the form (p^q)(p^q) with prime numbers p is not equals to q is called a hybrid-integer.
For example, 800 = (2^5)(5^2) is a hybrid-integer.

We define C(n) to be the number of hybrid-integers less than or equal to n.
You are given C(800) = 2 and C(800^800) = 10790.

Find C(800800^800800). Write the code in C#
